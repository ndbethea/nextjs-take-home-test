One of the most common problems I think customers ask Vercel to help with is, troubleshooting errors. How I would help customers is:

Short Term
- Reply in a timely manner on how customers can effectively troubleshoot errors, and help them better understand why the error ocurred
- Take into consideration common errors customers face and communicate with the proper team on how these issues can be resolved going forward

Long Term
- Update documentation for future users who may face common issues using Next.js
- Provide example videos on how to troubleshoot common errors within the community of Next.js users
